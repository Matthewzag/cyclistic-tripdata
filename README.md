## Project Overview
Cyclistic is a bike-share company based in Chicago. This project analyzes 12 months of bike trip data to:
1. Compare usage patterns of casual riders and members.
2. Provide data-backed marketing strategies for converting casual riders to members.

## Data Sources
The data used in this analysis includes Cyclisticâ€™s anonymized historical trip data from September 2023 to August 2024. Each trip includes:
- Start and end times
- Start and end locations
- Rider type (casual or member)
- Bike type (classic or electric)

The data is publicly available through [Divvy's data portal](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) under the [Divvy Data License Agreement](https://divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).
